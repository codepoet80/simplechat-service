# SimpleChat Service

This is a very simple, very tiny, public chat service.

It provides little in the way of security or privacy, its just a way for people to share short messages with each other.

It was originally written for webOS users, but could be used for other retro devices as well.

There's also a discord bot that can be integrated with it to share messages to-and-from a discord server: https://github.com/codepoet80/simplechat-discordbot
