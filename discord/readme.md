This bot can be added to a discord server to copy messages to and from your local chat. SimpleChat will try to communicate with it on the port you set.

Its really safe to leave this folder inside a web directory unless you restrict access to localhost.

# Sample .htaccess

```
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
Allow from 127.0.0.1
```
